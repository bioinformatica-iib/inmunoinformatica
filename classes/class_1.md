## Micro Project Group Work

Make sure to read through all of this page before starting the micro-project

### Background

Immunological bioinformatics is annotated as a MSc/PhD eligible course, meaning that you will most likely be at the end of your studies when taking this course or you may be a PhD student or even a postdoctoral researcher. Today you will do active learning-work with a learning method called "Inquiry based learning", which is quite close to the way a researcher works, therefore I have chosen this as the teaching method of the day.

Briefly, "Inquiry based learning" is based on a main question defining the topic and subsequently a series of investigative questions are generated. By working with and answering these questions, a deeper knowledge on the topic is obtained compared to simply sitting passively in on a classic lecture.

This course requires a working understanding of the bio-molecular mechanisms underlying human immunity to infection, so without further ado, the main question of today is:

**A one-immunity-gene-one-pathogen system is obviously not possible, so how is it that we as humans are able to respond to infections by pathogens that we have never been exposed to before?**

<div class="foo">

|      Time     |Activity                                                                                                                                              |
|:--------------|:-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 09.30 - 10.30 | In your groups, identify "10 things you need to know more about to answer the main question" Choose 1-2 things to study further Draft a PowerPoint presentation with the 10 things you have identified 1-2 things you have chosen to study further Beginning of the answer to the 1-2 things "It has something to do with.." |
| 10.30 - 11.00 | Return to the class room Be prepared to present your drafted PowerPoint presentation Some groups will randomly be selected to present their work-in-progress and get feedback from fellow students                                                                                                                           |
| 11.00 - 15.00 | Go to your groups and complete the presentation and your in depth answers to the 1-2 things Expect to present 10 minutes, followed by 2-3 minutes of questions There will be some overlap between the presentations, so each group is responsible for identifying "What was new here?" from the group presenting before them |
| 15.00 - 17.00 | Return to the class room, each group will present their findings                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |

*In total, you will have ~4h including lunch to work on this micro-project, so stay focused! I know, that most likely this is quite different from what you are used to, but I hope you will keep an open mind and remember that research into teaching and learning clearly indicate that this setup is effective for you to do “better learning” - Enjoy learning!*

### Remarks

- Make sure you state your "10 things" as questions
- For the final presentation, make sure to include references
- Do not include slides from other courses
- Do not reference a website, if you find a nice figure, trace it to its origin
- In general only reference official publications, i.e. scientific papers, books and reports
- The 10 minutes is sharp - you will be stopped, so keep time
